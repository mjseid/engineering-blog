#Cloud Foundry User administration

In the third installation of our open source [Cloud Foundry (CF) toolbox series](http://engineering.monsanto.com/2015/07/22/building-an-open-source-cloud-foundry-toolbox/), we unveil [CF-Users](https://github.com/MonsantoCo/cf-users). This application offers a web based solution for managing Cloud Foundry user credentials and authorizations.   CF-Users is an enabler of DevOps by putting more power into the development teams to manage users. It also simplifies user administration by reducing the number of steps needed to add users and manage roles.

CF-Users gives power to the development teams by allowing both organization managers and space managers to manage users in Cloud Foundry.  While both organization managers and space managers can add users, they may only assign roles at their level of authority.  For instance a space manager may only assign space developer, space manager, and space auditor roles to spaces for which that manager has the space manager role.  Organization managers may add users and assign any role within the organization for which they are assigned.  Whereas each development team may be given at least one user in the space manager role, more responsibility may pushed to these teams to manage their own users.  By giving more power to organization managers and space managers, we reduce our reliance on an ops team for managing users.

In a large organization, relying on the command line interface to add users and configure multiple roles to individuals is a cumbersome task that has been taking increasingly more time as we have become more reliant on Cloud Foundry. The number of steps needed to manage users is greatly reduced by offering the ability to simultaneously add a user and configure permissions.  This takes what is a multistep process at the command line and reduces it to one form entry and submittal; thus, greatly reducing the steps needed to add a user.  CF-Users also offers two different workflows for modifying a users roles within Cloud Foundry.  This allows assignment of roles from the most convenient perspective needed.  For instance, if a new organization or space has been added, the User Role Admin page may be used to assign roles to multiple users at that level without the need to navigate several web pages.   Conversely, if only one user needs permissions added, the Edit User screen may be used to assign multiple roles for that user.  Efficiency is greatly improved by reducing the effort needed to complete such tasks to a few mouse clicks.

## Using the application

### Add User
Organization managers and space managers both may add users to with CF-Users.  However, organization managers may only assign roles within organizations that that they manager.  Likewise, space managers may only assign roles within spaces that they manage.  Just enter the username and optionally password depending on the type of user account created, select roles for the user, and click the Create User button.

### Edit User
This screen allows organization managers and space managers to modify the privileges assigned to users.  The user roles may be selected or deselected by clicking the appropriate checkboxes.   The privileges are updated as these checkboxes are clicked and feedback is given with a growl message when the action is completed.

### User Role Admin
This screen allows privilege modification from the perspective of the organization and spaces rather than from the user perspective.  This is accomplished by allowing the selection of the organization and/or space and displaying a list of users who have can be assigned roles at the chosen level.  As with edit user, The privileges are updated as the checkboxes are clicked and feedback is given with a growl message when the action is completed.
